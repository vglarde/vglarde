**Currently working in Editorial, but AI is taking over!**

In all aspects of my job, I can see how rapidly AI is gaining ground, from Machine Translation tools (such as *Google Translate*, *Systran Translate*, or *DeepL*) which are rapidly improving, to AI-Assisted Content Creation (like *ChatGPT*).

I am currently enrolled in a [CoGrammar Skills Bootcamp](https://skills.cogrammar.com/) with *HyperionDev* (March-June 2024), studying Data Science and Python. 

Machine learning models are fascinating. I love new challenges, and I am looking forward to starting a new career in Tech as **Data Engineer**. 

Data Science is new to me, but I have a previous experience with coding. Back in 2006, I taught myself PHP/MySQL, and worked as Web Developer for 6+ years.
